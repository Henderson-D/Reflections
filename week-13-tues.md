## From the Videos ##
> From the videos, I learned much more about closures from these videos. Just seeing the example shown on Tuesday pt2 actually clicked inside of my head exactly what the closures do. Also, the video breakdown on our part for the teach back also gave me a much better
> understanding for understanding closures as well.

> .map actually does make perfect sense to me as well. I did not have any issue with this on my end, as far as I am aware at least lol

* As far as the for / while:
  * map does seem to iterate through the array much like a (for) function would with i=0/i++

> However, map seems to have advantages over the for/while loops for a few reasons:
 * It is much shorter
 * It is straight forward, less to read initially
 * There is no mutation of the original values, keeps them pure

> It goes without saying, my original closures example was pretty far off. So, for the differences, there were quite a bit. Again, the main thing that I picked up from these videos is an actual understanding of closures, especially how they are formatted and so forth.

> I also really liked the examples of .map by the (function(element, index, array)) and the explanation that each element will essentially be passed through the function. This made perfect sense and I really do not believe that I have any questions about these topics at
> this time.
