## Introduction ##

* Technophilia - the enthusiasm generated by the use of technology, particularly new technologies

> Unique tasks are the bane of existence for end users in most cases. Most people needing a computer, or series of computers, to do something for them must navigate down a path that has already been traversed. For me, at work, I constantly run into this problem. Whether it be testing new equipment or completing a task, innovation and expansion does not wait for someone else to give you the keys to the vehicle.

> Programming being fundamentally tedious is definitely true, a simply missing </xyz> in HTML could cause a snowball of errors

> In terms of it being rewarding, I completly agree. I worked with a CPA once that explained that he began hating talking to humans, because of his programming experience. With programming, as long as you know what you are doing, you can accomplish exactly what you want. Programs will never have opinions or vary from their given task, whereas people will.

* Programming language - artificially constructed language, not actually how the computer communicates.

* BASIC and DOS were main method of interacting with computers
 * BASIC Example- INPUT "Enter a nice number for me! > ", n%
 * DOS Example- @echo off  
   echo Welcome to DOS programming!  
   pause  
   dir
* A program is simply a piece of text typed up by a programmer that is "translated" by a computer to make the block of text actually be useful

* A program can combine an enormous number of these simple actions to do very complicated things
> This would be what RAM would do, allowing access to different applications faster than would be available if those applications were not cached with such availablity

* "A program is a building of thought. It is costless to build, it is weightless, and it grows easily under our typing hands"
> Valuing your time would be important, but fundamentally, it is "free." It would just be worth noting that there are important factors, such as time, that should be factored in. Without factoring in your time, efficiencies that could have been created, aren't.

* Some programmers believe that this complexity is best managed by using only a small set of well-understood techniques in their programs.

> I tend to start my programs with some form of controlled chaos. Maybe variables aren't set yet, maybe I haven't perfected it in some way; however, I agree with the book. The simple way of doing the same things over and over are completely boring. I believe this is where AI is most helpful. Whether it be typing up some super easy piece of code just to save some time or getting a new way to complete a task, AI is a key component to stopping this.

* There are many terrible mistakes to make in program design, and you should go ahead and make them so that you understand them

> I agree with this! My last example is exactly why. I do have some controlled chaos, but I understand where I can avoid issues while doing that. Setting a million different lines of code to run and then getting an error would be irritating. Therefore, I know after I type in specific components, I run the program and see what's wrong. Then, I can correct the issues and avoid even more headaches.

* I would hate to code in binary, very much so.

* let total = 0, count = 1;  
while (count <= 10) {  
  total += count;  
  count += 1;  
}  
console.log(total);  
// → 55  

> This is much more readable.  
> total = 0, count = 1  
> run while count is less than or equal to 10  
> total= total+ count  
> count increases by one  

* console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
// → 55

* Javascript introduced in '95 as a way to add programs to web pages in Netscape Navigator browser

* Has nothing to do with Java

* ECMAScript and Javascript are the same thing

* Older browser is likely not going to support newer features, IE im looking at you
