### What is the terminal? What are some synonyms for it? ###
* The terminal is Git Bash, in our case. This is a command line interface, or CLI. CLI is a synonym for terminals, as well as console user interface.
### What is the prompt ###
* A prompt is sometimes prefaced by 'git' in our case. For example, for "Git add," add would be the prompt. The prompt is your desired action to be taken. "Git commit" would commit, "Git Status" would return your status in the repository, and so forth.
### What is a directory ###
* A directory is essentially a file location. An example of this would be, "This PC>OS (C:)>Users>DerrickWHenderson" The directory for this would be DerrickWHenderson, nested in the folders before it. A directory is used to organize files in a way that is easier to navigate, rather than one large mass collection of files.
### What is "cd" ###
* "cd" would enter you into your home directory. If you were in "Code" and you entered "cd" you would return back to your parent directory location. Pwd would show you exactly where that parent directory is located.
### What is npm? What does it stand for? What is it used for? ###
* npm, or Node Package Manager, allows for package installation, such as "Package.JSON" and also helps with keeping track of said packages. Packages such as Package.JSON are useful as they are often already created and are ready-for-use packages of code.
### What file must be present for npm to work (Manifest file) ###
* Package.JSON must be present, as it is the manifest file.
### How do we add a script to Package.JSON ###
* Locate the Package.JSON file and enter the script directly to the file, or if a "scripts" section exists, enter the script there.
### How do we install a package? Why would we want to do this? ###
* "npm i (or install) *package name*" This is often done as it is code that has already been created and tested, by people with more experience than myself. This leads to better turnaround time with a project, less work, and repeatable efficiencies
### What is Vite ###
* Vite allows for seemingly instantaneous results when doing, in our case, HTML. You can click out of VS Code and the newly edited code is already being applied to the localhost server with the file you are working on, allowing for instant feedback

* # General Notes From Office Hours #
  ## Questions / General Information that I picked up on ##
* cd . . - up one level, like hitting the back arrow
* mv - move command "mv *name of code*"
* rm - removes, this does NOT ask you again
* git log - Log of all of the work previously completed
* history - history of all commands (or CMD-F for Mac to 'find')
* What is GitHub? GitHub is a service that allows us to host git repositories, much like cloud storage. GitHub also allows for code to be accessed on a different computer, as it is not only locally stored.
* You do NOT want to clone repo inside of another repo, this is why my Code repository is not functioning properly
* NPM- Node Package Manager
* Don't do rm rm . - this deletes pretty much EVERYTHING from the computer (including OS?)
* Where is package.JSON installed? Node directory
* do NOTE keep node modules in GitHub because they can be thousands of files
* Style Lint - 'Cleans' CSS, a way to help us enforce best practices used in everyday business by much more experienced people. It is a code quality tool.
* Viet - auto updates from VS to Local Server
* AutoSave on Focus Change - if prettier is 'red', there are errors/broken code

* Used to condense CSS into a MUCH smaller amount of CSS

## Review wrap-up ##
* Vite auto updates
* To kill off, Cntl-C (you can do this when it is not auto updating)

## What does it all mean to me / Does it make sense? ##
> The terminology being explained does make sense, that is not a foreign concept. I do feel like I understand the vocabulary and the general ways around how to use npm, git status, git add, etc. However, what does not make the most sense to me is how to create a repository, such as Code, without being in the home directory. I am not sure if I am confused based off the visual differences from the Mac examples, or what. But I did follow along exactly, I thought, with the videos. Yet, I apparently failed and have a nested repository. While I would say I am by no means confident in my abilities like I would be when using Visual Studio, I do feel like I am actually learning and the most recent examples, especially 'Office Hours,' has been making more sense. I do appreciate the extra assistance in Teams and so forth, that has also helped the content make more sense. I also agree! Please continute to continue doing Office Hours. While it would be beneficial for me if it were not mandatory, I would definitely prefer having content available of someone of my skill level being walked through the material.
## Can I imagine how these tools might be useful to your future 'real work' ##
> Absolutely! The company that I work for is owned by an accountant and a software engineer. I am thankful as I make my own work schedule and the software engineer shows me ways to do certain tasks at work using what we have recently learned in class, whether it be this class, SQL, or so forth. I have already assisted in building our company website, changing listings, etc. I can imagine that we would use GitHub to do exactly what it was built for: to access code remotely and store it somewhere other than our local server.

## What dont I like about it? What would I change? ##
> I greatly dislike the fact that I cannot to Cntrl-C or Cntrl-V in Git Bash. Also, I do not like that I am unable to copy multiple lines in Git Bash and paste them. For example, if there are 5 things to do "Git add" to and I do "Git status," then copy those 5 items, on different lines, then paste them, it will show me an error and will not add those items on lines 2-5. I actually do not believe it will even add item on line 1, but I am unsure. This is nit picky, but I do unfortunately not know much about Git Bash yet, so I am attempting to not want to add a bunch of features, mostly because I am sure that they exist, just not in my realm.

## Sorry if I missed any questions in the video! I did take notes throughout and attempted to be as descriptive as possible while keeping answers somewhat medium length. ##
