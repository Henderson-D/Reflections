## General Notes ##
* To link HTML with JS: ``` <script type = "module" src="/main,js"></scipt> ```
* ESM is the modern way to modularize our code

> In general, the data scraping is not new to me, as I have helped build a data scraper for item titles and prices that automatically goes through all eBay recently sold items for work. However, the general idea of everything was nice to revisit! After not working with it for a while, I was initially a little rusty; however, the general idea quickly came back and using some of that psuedo-SQL-esq-style that I exemplified was nice to get back into!

> Actually, what I liked the most was the last assignment, specifically the last To-Do on the assignment. I had fun figuring out how to use map in the way that I did while messing with the two arrays. I had seen that style prior, but had not had a chance to implement it in anything, so this was a fun 'first' for me! Also, the import and export makes complete sense. I have been using a lot of import and export with the AI github repositories that I am using. Also, I have familiarity with python as well.

> I did find the To-Do: #4 a little challenging; however, the other learning material that I intake daily has been helping out with new concepts to help my mind structure out a potential solution to these problems. I do really like
> incrementing things by index, when possible, as well. The map feature combined with index in my solution was actually pretty interesting as well. When doing the problem, I knew that I needed to increment both arrays and that I could do
> aleast one with map, the other I thought of using map; however, I settled on simply using index as it was the 'easiest' was and seemed to make perfect sense to me.

> ```const newName array.from(oldName)``` was also pretty cool, I believe on my old data scraper that I used something a little different. Yet, I could have used this and just not remembered it
