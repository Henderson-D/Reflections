# Homework Review Notes #
> Computers are generally tools, much like a screwdriver, as referenced. Just like a screwdriver takes some time to become proficient in using, as an extended part of your arm, programming and
> computers must take some time to become an extension of your mind and imagination. Emphasized by the "building of thought" that the book talks about.

* Programming is TEDIOUS
> The satisfaction I get from programming is finally finishing a project and learning new items as well as getting over whatever issue I was experiencing during that project

* High-level languages are more similar to human language than low-level, which is more like the binary that we went over

* You are correct, I had no idea what class-based programming meant, but I did look it up on my own.

* I have read, "Oracle is a law firm that just so happens to have software" and I kind of chuckled when you mentioned JavaScript being trademarked
