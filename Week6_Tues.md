# Homework Review Notes #
> Computers are generally tools, much like a screwdriver, as referenced. Just like a screwdriver takes some time to become proficient in using, as an extended part of your arm, programming and
> computers must take some time to become an extension of your mind and imagination. Emphasized by the "building of thought" that the book talks about.

* Programming is TEDIOUS
> The satisfaction I get from programming is finally finishing a project and learning new items as well as getting over whatever issue I was experiencing during that project

* High-level languages are more similar to human language than low-level, which is more like the binary that we went over

> I have seen so many ad's about, "MAKE SIX FIGURES IN TECH" and they are very tiring. I agree with your statement that the book had the advantage that it was clear-cut in the difficulties involved.

> I do agree with you that often staying in a zone and utilizing best practices is beneficial. This breeds efficiencies. It is the comfort of understanding that stifles the growth of your mind.

> Steps to solving the problem are important. I do this at work fairly often, often only with basic HTML.

* JavaScript is not JUST OOP

> My favorite language at the moment, C#, seems like it also has a similar syntax to JavaScript. So, it is weird that they would compare JavaScript and Java if syntax is the only similarity.

* MongoDB we will use with Node

# Video 3 #
> It was not nearly as interesting, I agree.

> JavaScript is a cross-platform language, meaning it can be used for OS or webpages

> JavaScript is a Multi-Peridigm

* JavaScript IS OOP but not ONLY OOP

* We will mostly be doing client-side JavaScript with objects to control a browser and Document Object Model (DOM)

* You are correct, I had no idea what class-based programming meant, but I did look it up on my own.

* I have read, "Oracle is a law firm that just so happens to have software" and I kind of chuckled when you mentioned JavaScript being trademarked

# NodeJS Video #
* begin in directory you want to use
* .vscode directory which will have extensions.JSON and settings.JSON
  * these must be named exactly as such to work in VS Code
  * VS Code will recognize .vscode dir
  * .fileName is hidden
  * ls -a to list hidden dir
* ALWAYS INSTALL EXTENSIONS WHEN PROMPTED

> On the topic of being able to paste, why is it that cntrl-v doesn't simply work? I found this to be a little odd when I first ran across the issue

> Just figured it out, to paste in windows GitBash, you do cntrl-ins to copy and shift-ins to paste

* Do not install a bunch of extensions randomly, themes are okay

* extensions.JSON essentially just makes things easier for you, whether is be comments or errorcodes, etc.

* settings.JSON formats code, all good things

* npm- Node Package Manager

* eslint is like stylelint, holding space where we can install packages and modules into the project

* npm init --yes
> initializes project to use npm
> activates package.JSON (i think)

* settings.JSON oversides any settings that may be being used

* package.JSON - allows us to start using npm

* npm init @eslint/config

* airbnb is the strictest of style guides

* when npm install, node_modules dir is created

* per ChatGPT: the rc stands for "runtime configuration" or "run control"

* adding prettier to configuration file presumably allows prettier to configure the code

* node modules are little chunks of JavaScript that integrate together to create something like eslint

* ES modules are the new standard of JS modules

* to do: "airbnb-base" and "prettier", you must do ["airbnb-base"], ["prettier"]

* we want node_modules to be ignored by GitHub

* right click > New File > name ".gitignore" > have co-pilot create a .gitignore file > initialize as a git repo "git init" > git add . > git status > git commit -m "Initial Commit"
> This is a special commit message where it simply initializes the repo

> This was interesting and I believe that I understand the extensions/settings.json more now. Also, the ["XYZ"] is new to me as well, so that is definitely helpful to know!
