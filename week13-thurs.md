## General Notes, Let's Read ##
* BOM - Browser Object Model
 * Provides objects to interact with the web browser
*BOM key factors are:
 - Window Object: such as browser window
  - like popup windows
 - Nav Object: provides info about brower, such as name, version, operating system
 - Location Object: URL, path to specific location, provides methods to redirect browser to another URL
 - History Object: Provides methods to interact with browsers session history, pages that were visited in that specific tab, like back arrow
 - Screen Object: Provides info about screen size, resolution
 - Document Object: part of the DOM, but document object is also assessible through BOM, allows scripts to manipulate the page

* DOM - Document Object Model (Meaning HTML document)
 * Provides objects to interact with the document structure, style, and content
*__Key Factors:__
 * Nodes: a building block, like <p> or <div>, etc
 * Element Nodes: Much like the above
 * Text Nodes: Represents the text __INSIDE__ of elements, <p>Like This</p>
 * Attributes: Can include things like ID's, classes, src, href, etc
 * Document: HTML or XML (LOL at the not worry about XML comment, I thought the same thing initially)
