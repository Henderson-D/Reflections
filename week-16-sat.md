## This was the hardest assignment this semester ##
> This was not necessarily hard, it was just a few issues that I had no idea how to go away. I ended up throwing everything under the sun to correct my issue and it went away. I followed along with the code along pretty closely, it made perfect sense; until my error message wouldn't go away.
> Generally, the JS and HTML are not insane concepts are are generally understandable to me. I did have a pretty good understanding of a lot of the code. It was a little unreadable at first glance. However, as you said, once you break it down line by line, it is much easier to understand.

> I still do not fully understand how validator functions; however, I implemented it as shown as I thought that it was interesting.
>
> I did not change my general HTML much; however, I did mix up my iframe and also corrected the background on the text input areas as it was light pink on a white background, I don't remember this being the case when I initially submitted this assignment.

## Form Validation ##
> Recently, I have been finding it amusing when I stumble across a site that asks for an email/phone number. Typically, I test to see if it even checks the phone number or if it has a text code to enter to verify; most don't. For whatever reason, this is interesting to me and I would like
> to look up how to enable the text/email verification with a code, this may be a nice extra snippet. However, I will likely look this up on my own.

> The form validation made sense, it checks if xyz is correct and if so, it is validated. However, the validation that we "npm i validator"'ed, I am not sure how that works. As far as the functionality of the form, I think the email/phone section wasn't the best way for me to implement the
> validation as "required" is kind of a validator itself as it checks the information. However, for other instances of forms, it definitely is useful. eventListeners are interesting, as I would not typically think of things as eventListeners that actually are. I would assume that eventListeners
> on touch screen/PC/joystick devices would be a very long list when creating something that is to be used amongst all possibilities. For example, the Wii web browser, how obscure. I would assume that Nintendo did something on their end to trick the website into thinking the point-able hand is
> actually a mouse on PC or similar.

> Again, hiding the error was by far the hardest part for me. I ended up swapping a few different things for various reasons, as I preferred one thing over another after reviewing my previous work. However, this assignment was not insanely difficult. However, the items that were difficult were
> really difficult.
